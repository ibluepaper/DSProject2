âœ” This is my Data Structure course project.

ðŸ’Ž The idea of project is written down here and description of project is available in Description.pdf file in Persian language.

+ Design a system by which the user can search the symptoms and then find the name of disease and its medication.
+ Diseases should be stored in a Hash table. Use B-tree for separate chaining collision resolution strategy.
+ In even levels of B-trees, keys should be sorted increasingly. While, they should be sorted decreasingly in odd levels.
+ Minimum degree â€˜tâ€™ of B-trees and Hash table array size should be defined parametric.
